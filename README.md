# Birth Weekday ðŸŽ‚

A fun little app that tells you the day of the week your birthday will fall on for the next several years.

Go check it out at [birthweekday.com](https://www.birthweekday.com)!

## Technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as the absolute best React framework
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon) for date manipulation
- [React spring](https://www.react-spring.io) for spring physics based animations
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) for maintaining and persisting global state via localStorage
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment and hosting
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) for styles

## Noteworthy:

I'm pretty proud of the scheme I came up with here to switch between the light and dark themes on the fly; which makes use of both SCSS variables and CSS custom properties.

Implementing this has made me curious about how other sites tackle this problem.
